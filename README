An implementation of the matrix-vector product unit
for 32x32 matrices.

The implementation is described in the src/mvp.aa
file.  It has a toplevel daemon which reads the
input matrix, and then works on input vectors
to produce product vectors.  

The contents of this directory are as follows:

src/
	mvp.aa
	
testbench/
	testbench.c
		a simple test bench which sends
		a specific matrix and specific
		vectors to the hardware using
		a sender thread, and uses a second
		receiver thread to read back the
		product vectors and confirm that
		they are as expected.
